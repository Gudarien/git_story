I am here to tell you the tale of a half dragon half human hybrid his name was Colton. He was strong and worked hard to belong and be helpful. But alas he was never accepted. During his life he lived alone. But one day that all changed. Lost and alone he finally saw a light that lit up his path. But alas he was so deeply wounded that he could not see the light.
